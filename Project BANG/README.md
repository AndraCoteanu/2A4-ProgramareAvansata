## game designed by Coteanu Andra
### (c) all rights for the boardgame idea, logo and the cards designs go to their rightfull owners 

This game is meant to be a demo for my bachelor thesis.
What you can do right now with this game:
  + you can see the rule book
  + you can open fragments of the rule book while in the middle of a game (helpful if you're a beginner)
  + you can start a game
    + set the number of players you want
    + set a name for yourself
  + after the game is created you can 
    + see the other players (bots) and some info about them
    + see all the info available about yourself, including the cards you start with
    + the character crads and the sheriff badge are clickable (the pop-up and you can clearly see what character does everyone have)
    + you can leave the game anytime by using: the x - close button, the leave button that appears on the left of the screen or by clicking 'Game' -> 'Exit' in the menu bar 

!! disclaimer: the game isn't yet playable, nor is it finnished
